												<h2>Stroke</h2>
												<p>What to do?</p>
											</header>
											<p>Ischemic Stroke: This occurs due to a blockage of blood flow in the brain or a lack of blood flow to the brain. Blood carries oxygen to the brain, and when there is a lack of blood flow, it can lead to ischemic shock.

												Hemorrhagic Stroke: This happens when a vessel in the brain suddenly ruptures, causing a blood leak and an increase in intracranial pressure.

												<h2>Seizure</h2>
												<p>What you need to know?</p>
											</header>
											<p>Seizure: A neurological disorder characterized by sudden, recurrent episodes of sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, or convulsions, caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.</p>
											<header>
												<h2>Safety Precaution.</h2>
												<p>Airway, Breathing, and Circulation.
													Ensure oxygen and suction equipment are close by.
													During a seizure, lay the individual on their left side.
													Remove all sharp objects that could cause injury.
													Ensure the individual is breathing.
													Loosen any restrictive clothing.
													Call 911.

												<h2>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation</h2>
												<p>What you need to know?</p>
											</header>
											<p>ardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is a lifesaving technique that combines chest compressions and artificial ventilation to maintain circulatory flow and oxygenation during cardiac arrest. CPR is performed when the heart stops beating, with the primary goal of preserving brain function until further measures can restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing. This emergency procedure is crucial for increasing the chances of survival and reducing potential brain damage following cardiac arrest.</p>
											<h2>Step by step CPR for Kids</h2>
												<p>1. Check the Scene for Safety.</p>
												<p>Here's a step-by-step guide for performing CPR on children: First, ensure the environment is safe and check if the child is responsive by tapping and shouting. If unresponsive, call 911 or have someone else call for emergency help immediately. Observe the child’s chest for any signs of breathing for no more than 10 seconds, and if they are not breathing or only gasping, begin CPR. Place the heel of one hand (or two hands for older children) in the center of the child’s chest, just below the nipple line, and push down hard and fast at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, compressing the chest by about 1/3 to 1/2 of its depth, allowing full chest recoil between compressions. Tilt the child’s head back slightly, lift the chin to open the airway, and pinch the nose shut. Cover the child’s mouth with yours, creating a seal, and give 2 breaths, each lasting about 1 second, ensuring the chest rises. Continue cycles of 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths until emergency help arrives or the child shows signs of life. If the child begins to breathe normally, place them in the recovery position and monitor their condition until help arrives. Regardless of recovery, ensure the child receives a medical evaluation as soon as possible.</p>
												<h2>Step by step CPR for Adult</h2>
												<p>To perform CPR on an adult, first ensure the environment is safe and check if the person is responsive by tapping them and shouting. If unresponsive, call 911 or have someone else call for emergency help immediately. Check for breathing by observing the chest for any movement for no more than 10 seconds. If the person is not breathing or only gasping, begin CPR. Place the heel of one hand in the center of the person’s chest, with the other hand on top, interlocking your fingers. Push down hard and fast at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, compressing the chest at least 2 inches deep and allowing for full recoil between compressions. After 30 chest compressions, open the airway by tilting the head back slightly and lifting the chin, then pinch the nose shut. Cover the person’s mouth with yours, creating a seal, and give 2 rescue breaths, each lasting about 1 second and ensuring the chest rises. Continue cycles of 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths until emergency help arrives or the person shows signs of life. If the person starts breathing normally, place them in the recovery position and monitor their condition until help arrives. Regardless of recovery, ensure the person receives a medical evaluation as soon as possible.</p>
